# EZ D&D
Hi! 
This project was written and made by Gabe Ron.
I have so far built the base libraries.
I'm going to be working on the CLI and GUI, and refactoring a lot of code.
Please stay posted for actual updates past just libraries.
Feel free to add features or contribute.

## How to build
So there are a few steps that need to be taken to use and develop for the libraries.
Firstly, you need to setup C++.

#### Windows
* Download and setup [C++ for VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp)
* Download and setup [CMake for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vector-of-bool.cmake-tools)
* Download and setup [POCO for Windows](https://pocoproject.org/index.html)
(only necessary if you plan on using prebuilt networking class)
* Download the distributable from the Github package manager
* Use the libraries to your heart's content!

Sorry if this explanation is bad; I'm a Linux superuser

#### Linux
* Download g++ from your package manager
* Download cmake from your package manager
* Download POCO from your package manager
* Download the distributable from the Github package manager
* Use the libraries to your heart's content!

It looks bad but is actually real easy on Linux.

## How to use
So the base libraries have been built, and its almost ready to use.
I need to clean some stuff up but a CLI or GUI is coming soon.
I pormise (that was intentional).

## Contributing
Basically just follow general OSS contribution rules.
Please stick to the code formats I've set(?) with my code.
This includes but is not limited to:
* camelCase
* UPPERCASE CONSTANTS
* Descriptive naming
* Undescriptive naming
* Documentation
* Praising lord G̷̳̼͍̗̪̬̩̲͛͌̽͆̑ ̴̛̖̈́͜͝Ȁ̶̠͉̙͎̤̋̓̍̾͗͝ ̴̡̠̯̺̰͐̊Ṙ̶͓̙͈͉͚̉͂̎ ̵̢͓̫̩̹̦͔̭̽́̃͊́F̶̬͖̙͉̑̔̊̎͋̓͛͘ ̴̧̮̙̙̟͕͌̉̉I̶̜̦͗̽̕ ̸̪̼̋̿̂͑͐͝E̵̢͍̋̑͆̂̎͐̍͝ ̶͉͇̬͙̮͗͌͊̔̈̚L̸̢̤̳͚̠͓̓̿̅̽̅́ͅ ̴̪̼͓́̾̔̇̆̀̆̎Ď̸̙̳͈͕̪̗̿

Overall, just try to find an issue or featurerequest **with triage approved**.
Or you can propose one and see if it gets approved. 
Just work on it and follow the guidelines and we good.

And please use a separate branch.

## Thanks and Contributions
This project would not be possible without tools such as
