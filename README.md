# EZ D&D
Hi! 
This project was written and made by Gabe Ron.
I really haven't done much with it.
Right now I have a few basic features developed.
If you wanna use what I've developed more power to you.
Just know that this is GNU GPL v3, not MIT!
So yeah.
That's all I guess.

## How to build
* Setup C++ on Windows with VSCode.
* Setup C++ on *Nix by installing g++.

Now clone the code into wherever you want and build based off CMake.
I dunno what else to say. 
I've been trying to document my code but we'll see where that goes.
So yeah.
Have fun.

## How to use
I haven't even figured that out so, have fun!

## Contributing
This is far from ready for everyone so for now, if you *really* feel like you need to help, email me at macrocode@yahoo.com.
Otherwise, just wait until Alpha comes out.
In the meantime, you can learn how to use Catch2!
