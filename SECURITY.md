## Supported Versions

This will show you which version I'll support and work on. 
As I haven't even released an Alpha, I ain't supporting jack.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| ALPHA   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

So reporting a vulnerability is pretty simple.

Just email me at macrocode@yahoo.com as that's the only way I know how (for now).
Even though I'm not supporting alpha, if you find one please tell me.
I'll need to fix it.
